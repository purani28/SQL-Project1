# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project was to analyze user behavior and sales performance using PostgreSQL

## Process
Inserting Data: I started by inserting the tables into PostgreSQL
Data Cleaning : I cleaned the data to ensure consistency and accuracy. This included removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats across the tables.
SQL Queries: Lastly, I used PostgreSQL to answer questions in order to understand patterns and trends.

## Results
Through my analysis, I discovered several key insights:
1. There is a positive correlation between high visitor counts and high total transaction revenue in countries as more visitors would contribute to more sales.
2. San Francisco, United States contributes the most to the total revenue indicating that it is a major hub for sales. Majority of the cities contributing to the total revenue are from the United States, highlighting its importance in the market
3. Top 3 most popular categories are: Home/Shop by Brand/YouTube/, Home/Apparel/Men's/Men's-T-Shirts/ and Home/Electronics/
4. The "Shop by Brand/YouTube" category appears frequently across different countries showing a trend in consumers preferring branded products, especially in electronics and apparel.
5. There is a positive correlation between average time on site and the number of transactions completed. Visitors with higher average time on site a higher number of transactions, while those with lower times have fewer transactions.
    
## Challenges 
Some challenges I faced during the project included:
1. Data Quality: Inconsistent data entries required significant effort to clean.
2. Query Time: Query performance became a concern with larger datasets

## Future Goals
If I had more time, I would implement predictive analytics to forecast sales trends based on historical data, which could give a better understanding of inventory and marketing strategies.
